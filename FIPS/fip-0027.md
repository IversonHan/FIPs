## Simple Summary
Aggregating multiple transactions into a single transaction optimizes the user experience and reduces user overhead as paying for each transaction is expensive and cumbersome.

## Abstract
In the process of transaction creation, multiple transactions are aggregated into one transaction, and they are processed separately in the execution, 
thus reducing the cost of transaction execution and saving the cost of users.

## Change Motivation
Chain bandwidth is a valuable resource, necessary for both critical network operations and product use.
Avoiding frequent and high-gas-cost operations reduces contention, costs, and chain validation latency.

Given the state of the network, users have to pay a fee for each transaction, and the cost of calling multiple methods in a period of time is a significant cost to the user. Imagine a scenario where a user needs to transfer money to multiple addresses at the same time, but each transaction can only be transferred to one address,
which is extremely inconvenient for the user. On the other hand, it is also a very troublesome thing when the user needs to check the fund flow of his account.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Filecoin implementations. -->
1. Aggregating information from multiple calls into the parameters of a transaction.
2. Mark transactions in a specific way, route them to a specific processing method for execution, and reduce execution costs.

## Design Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
The handling of messages in the official project is quite mature, so changing the logic of the actor part of the code is not desirable. Therefore, in the stage of message routing, the message is intercepted, and then the message is split, and the transaction cycle execution after splitting is the most appropriate way. The advantage of this is that it does not affect the native logic, but only extends the functionality, ensuring the security and compatibility of the code.

The data structure of the message itself has jSON-formatted parameters, which can be used to carry multiple transactions. Multiple transactions are serialized into parameters and parsed at execution time.

Most of the cost of aggregating multiple transactions goes to tipping miners, whose job is simply to package transactions, so cutting tipping for miners can significantly reduce transaction costs for users.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All FIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The FIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. FIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->
None of these changes are intrusive changes to the official native code, but simply extend functionality to accommodate all operations.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for FIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other FIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->
N/A

## Security Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. FIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
None.

## Incentive Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the incentive implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for incentive discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will incentivize reliable and useful storage is required. FIP submissions missing the "Incentive Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Incentive Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
Aggregated transactions can greatly save users' expenses and facilitate users to check the flow of funds in their personal accounts.

## Product Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the product implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for product discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will enable better storage-related goods and services to be developed on Filecoin. FIP submissions missing the "Product Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Product Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->
This proposal will greatly reduce the cost of user transactions, generally making use of the Filecoin blockchain cheaper.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any core FIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the FIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
